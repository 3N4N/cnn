CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
============================

In this assignment of CSE472 course, we implement a CNN from scratch in python.

The layers implemented are as follows.

1. Convolution layer: There will be four (hyper)parameters: the number of output
   channels, filter dimension, stride, padding.
2. Activation layer: Implement an element-wise ReLU.
3. Max-pooling layer: There will be two parameters: filter dimension, stride.
4. Fully-connected layer: A dense layer. There will be one parameter: output
   dimension.
5. Flattening layer: It will convert a (series of) convolutional filter maps to
   a column vector.
6. Softmax layer: It will convert final layer projections to normalized
   probabilities.


The datasets to be used are MNIST and CFAR-10. The links are given below.
